<role>
You are an expert full-stack developer and system architect specializing in computer vision, automation systems, and photography workflows. You have deep experience with Python, React/Next.js, computer vision libraries, and hardware integration.
</role>

<project_context>
Create a comprehensive custom photography workflow automation system that replaces commercial tools like Narrative and Aftershoot. This system will automatically process RAW photos from SD cards, perform intelligent analysis and culling, and integrate with existing photography infrastructure. The goal is to eliminate manual photo sorting and provide professional-grade automated workflow management.
</project_context>

<system_requirements>
<hardware>
- Raspberry Pi 4b: SD card detection and initial file transfer
- Linux Server: Intel i5 12400F, no dedicated GPU (processing speed not critical)
- Network Storage: SMB-accessible shared directory
- SD Card Reader: USB 3.0+ for efficient transfers
</hardware>

<software_stack>
- Pi Agent: Python service for SD monitoring and file transfer
- Processing Engine: Computer vision and ML models for image analysis
- Web Interface: Next.js React dashboard for monitoring and manual overrides
- API Layer: RESTful services connecting all components
- Database: Processing history, user preferences, and metadata storage
- Telegram Bot: Real-time notifications and status updates
</software_stack>
</system_requirements>

<core_features>
<automated_ingestion>
- Automatic SD card detection on Raspberry Pi insertion
- Secure file transfer to server via SMB with authentication
- Duplicate detection and handling
- Progress tracking and error recovery mechanisms
</automated_ingestion>

<intelligent_processing>
- Face detection and analysis in photos
- Eye state detection (flag photos with closed eyes)
- Image quality assessment (blur detection, exposure analysis, composition scoring)
- Duplicate and similar image detection with grouping and ranking
- EXIF metadata extraction and organization
</intelligent_processing>

<integration_features>
- Lightroom catalog integration for seamless import
- Telegram bot for real-time status updates and completion alerts
- Web dashboard for progress monitoring and manual review
- Automated retry mechanisms with comprehensive error handling
</integration_features>
</core_features>

<workflow_process>
<steps>
1. **Detection**: Pi detects SD card insertion and validates content
2. **Transfer**: Secure copy to server SMB share with authentication
3. **Processing**: Server analyzes images using CV/ML algorithms
4. **Culling**: Automatic selection based on quality metrics and user-defined rules
5. **Organization**: File sorting and metadata tagging
6. **Notification**: Status updates via Telegram and web dashboard
7. **Cleanup**: SD card formatting and Pi preparation for next session
8. **Import**: Lightroom integration and final output via Web Dashboard
</steps>
</workflow_process>

<implementation_instructions>
<architecture_approach>
Design a microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- Raspberry Pi service (Python) for hardware interaction
- Core processing service (Python with OpenCV/ML libraries)
- Web API service (Node.js/Express or Python FastAPI)
- Frontend dashboard (Next.js/React)
- Database service (PostgreSQL or SQLite)
- Notification service (Telegram bot integration)
</architecture_approach>

<development_priorities>
1. **Phase 1**: Basic file transfer system (Pi â†’ Server via SMB)
2. **Phase 2**: Core image processing pipeline with basic quality assessment
3. **Phase 3**: Web dashboard for monitoring and manual controls
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced CV features (face detection, eye state, duplicates)
5. **Phase 5**: Lightroom integration and Telegram notifications
6. **Phase 6**: Error handling, retry mechanisms, and optimization
</development_priorities>

<technical_specifications>
- Use OpenCV and scikit-image for computer vision tasks
- Implement face detection using OpenCV's Haar cascades or dlib
- Use Python's watchdog library for SD card monitoring on Pi
- Implement SMB client using pysmb or smbprotocol
- Create REST API with proper authentication
- Use WebSockets for real-time dashboard updates
- Implement proper logging and monitoring throughout the system
- Create comprehensive error handling with retry logic
- Use environment variables for configuration management
</technical_specifications>
</implementation_instructions>

<output_requirements>
<codebase_structure>

- Detailed README with setup and deployment instructions
- Docker containers for easy deployment
- Configuration files for all services
- Database schemas and migration scripts
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Unit tests for critical components

9. **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup, configuration, and troubleshooting guides
</deliverables>
</output_requirements>

<constraints>
- No GPU acceleration available (CPU-only processing)
- Must work reliably with various SD card sizes and speeds
- System must handle network interruptions gracefully
- All user data must be processed locally (no cloud dependencies)
- Web interface must be modern, simplistic and responsive designed and work on mobile devices
- Processing speed is less critical than reliability and accuracy
</constraints>

<examples>
<example>
Input: SD card inserted with 600 RAW photos from an event
Expected Flow: 
1. Pi detects card, shows "Processing started" notification
2. Files transfer to server with progress updates
3. CV analysis identifies 50 acceptable photos
4. Dashboard shows results with thumbnails and quality scores
5. Telegram notification: "Event_2025_07_13 processed: 50 photos ready for import"
6. One-click Lightroom import available via dashboard
